# ðŸš€ Game Review GraphQL Server - Learning GraphQL!

Welcome to my Game Review GraphQL Server! This is a simple, playful project where I'm learning the ropes of GraphQL. It's all about managing data for games, authors, and reviews with a touch of GraphQL magic.

## About This Project

As a sandbox for exploring GraphQL, this server uses Apollo Server to perform some cool tricks with game-related data. From fetching lists of games to updating game details, itâ€™s my playground for mastering GraphQL queries and mutations.

### Cool Features:
- **Query Fun**: Pull data on games, authors, and reviews just by asking nicely.
- **Add Games**: Discover a new game? Add it to our virtual shelf.
- **Delete Duds**: Sometimes games flopâ€”zap those away!
- **Update Info**: Got the latest game update? Patch it through with an update mutation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to join in on the fun:

1. **Grab the Code**: `git clone https://github.com/tonyykosseifyy/graphql-app.git`
2. **Jump into the Directory**: `cd graphql-app`
3. **Install the Magic**: `npm install`
4. **Launch the Server**: `npm start`
5. **Play Around**: Fire up your favorite GraphQL client and hit up `http://localhost:4000`

Ready to play the game of learning GraphQL? This project is my testing ground, and I'm excited to share it with you. Dive in and see how GraphQL can level up your data management skills!

Happy querying and may your responses always return `200 OK`! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
